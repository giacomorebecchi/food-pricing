- Mamba: see the [official documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html);
- Conda: see the [official documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html).

### Cloning the project
To clone the project on your computer, run `git@github.com:giacomorebecchi/food-pricing.git` in your CLI. For additional details on how to clone GitHub repositories, you can check out this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Installing Python dependencies
Once the repository has been cloned, you can set the repository as the current working directory with the command:
```
